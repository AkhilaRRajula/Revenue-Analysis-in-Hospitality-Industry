****Revenue Insights in the Hospitality Industry****


**Project Overview:** Atliq Grands, a prominent chain of luxury hotels in India, has been facing challenges in the competitive hospitality sector due to ineffective decision-making and strategic advances by competitors. In an effort to regain their market share and boost revenue, the management decided to leverage data intelligence. However, lacking an in-house data analytics team, Atliq Grands engaged a third-party service provider to analyze their historical data and deliver actionable insights.

**Project Goals:** As a data analyst on this project, my primary objectives were to:

- Develop key metrics according to a provided metric list.
- Design and build a Power BI dashboard based on a stakeholder-provided mock-up.
- Generate additional insights beyond the basic metrics, enhancing decision-making capabilities.

**Key Insights:** The analysis uncovered valuable insights critical to Atliq Grands’ strategy:

**Highest Revenue Sources:** Mumbai leads in revenue generation (₹669M), followed by Bangalore, Hyderabad, and Delhi.
**Top Performing Property:** "Atliq Exotica" leads in revenue (₹320M), occupancy (57%), and customer rating (3.62).
**Highest Occupancy:** "Atliq Bay" achieved the highest occupancy rate at 66%.
**Peak Week:** Week 24 recorded the highest revenue at ₹139.6M.
**Strong Markets:** Delhi ranks top in both occupancy and customer satisfaction, followed by Hyderabad, Mumbai, and Bangalore.
**Revenue Loss from Cancellations:** The business faced a substantial revenue loss of ₹298M due to cancellations.
**Room Category Insights:** Elite rooms are the most booked and also have the highest cancellation rate.
**Metrics and Dashboard Highlights:** Using Power BI, I developed an interactive dashboard that provides a comprehensive view of the following metrics:

**RevPAR (Revenue Per Available Room):** A key indicator of revenue performance.
**ADR (Average Daily Rate):** Average revenue per sold room, offering insights into pricing efficiency.
**DBRN (Daily Booked Room Nights):** Tracks daily room bookings.
**DSRN (Daily Sellable Room Nights):** Monitors room availability for sale each day.
**DURN (Daily Utilized Room Nights):** Reflects the actual room usage by guests daily.

**Learning Outcomes:** This project provided a deep dive into the data dynamics of the hospitality industry, reinforcing my skills in using data analytics to solve real-world challenges. By developing this dashboard, I gained practical experience in turning complex data into strategic insights, helping Atliq Grands make informed business decisions.

**Data Model:** The data model integrates multiple datasets to present a unified view of revenue, occupancy, and customer satisfaction metrics, ensuring Atliq Grands’ management can track performance across different cities and property types effectively.
